### Purpose:

This project is a demonstration of error detection using odd parity and DFA.

### About:

Deterministic Finite Automaton implementation in python to detect odd parity errors in binary messages

* Parity Checking: Detects whether the number of 1s is even or odd.
* Parity Error Detection: Compares the actual parity with the expected parity.
* Validation: Validate binary strings against expected parity values.
* Test Cases: Test Bench to validate the output integrity of the system.

### Technologies Used:

* Python  
* Deterministic Finite Automaton theory
