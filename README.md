### Purpose:

This project serves as a basic demonstration of error detection using parity and DFA, which are common techniques used in communication systems and error-checking protocols.

### About:

Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) implementation in python to detect even/odd parity errors in binary messages

* Parity Checking: Detects whether the number of 1s in a binary string is even or odd.
* Parity Error Detection: Compares the actual parity of a binary string with the expected parity (even or odd).
* Python Implementation: The project includes a Python function to validate binary strings against expected parity values.
* Test Cases: Several test cases are provided to validate the correctness of the parity error detection.

### Technologies Used:

Python  
DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) theory
